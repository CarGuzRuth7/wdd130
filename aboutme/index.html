    <h2>Ruth Cardona</h2>
    <h2>Pantache</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone! I'm Ruth Cardona but my "artistic" nickname is Pantache ("ch" like children),
    this is a word game in Spanish that means Panda and Racoon. I am 25 years old, and I'm married. 
    I've been a member of the church my whole life. I served a mission at Temple Square in Utah,
    and it was a wonderful experience. </p>

    <p>I'm studying two careers, one in Applied Technology at BYU-I and one as a lyrical singer
    at the local Music Conservatory. I love to study and enjoy what I do, even though sometimes 
    it is hard. I like to draw, sing, watch anime and movies, play games and listen to music.</p>
    
    <p>What I love about BYU-Idaho is giving me opportunities to grow deeper in my faith and trust in God. 
    Now I believe more that I can become a good programmer than before. I started to study this career because 
    I want to find better job opportunities and grow professionally.
    I'm currently serving as a Seminary teacher, and I enjoy spending time with the youth.</p>
