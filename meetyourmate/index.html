                <p>A popular infusion from Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil is made with the leaf
                    and stem of “Ilex Paraguariensis” or Yerba Mate. This ancient tradition comes from
                    Guarani natives who used to chew the leaves or drink it like tea in a gourd and use a little cane as
                    a
                    straw. <br>
                    This deep-rooted tradition has been maintained through many centuries to the present day
                    and with many variations. As a ritual, the mate is served with hot water by the “cebador” or
                    primer and is drunk through a straw to filter the yerba. <br>
                    The mate is a valuable custom to those who drink it and has many meanings to each person,
                    and it is usually shared between family and friends.

            <div class="unity">
                <p>Even if many people like to drink mate alone, the main significance of mate is “unity.”
                    In many family meetings, people share their best traditions and reunite to have a family
                    moment to remember. And here is when the mate becomes a social connector where everyone
                    sits around the table to converse, remember moments, and construct new memories while
                    the mate goes by through each member. <br>
                    When you visit a friend or agree to meet somewhere with your group of friends,
                    always one of them will bring a mate to share. Sometimes it becomes an excuse
                    to meet and have a good time.

                <p>Whenever there is a long day of work, a lot of studies, or a long trip you can receive the
                    nice company of a mate. As a friend, the mate can be there in the daily parts of your life
                    to help you concentrate, think, or take a moment to feel relaxed. For many people, drink
                    mate alone is a way to connect with themselves or take a break and still feel accompanied
                    through daily activities.</p>
