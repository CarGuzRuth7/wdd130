      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you know what MATE is? Most people outside of Argentina, Uruguay, or South America do not know about this traditional tea. The first impression it gives is to think you are drinking grass in a cup with a straw or that you are on the dark side of the law. 
        Through my website, I pretend to share why "mate" is considered a great life companion and how it represents unity between family, friends, and community. A unity that invites to understand and respect each other traditions
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Through this website, I expect to reach people of all ages and different cultures that never heard of or have a little knowledge of what "Mate" is and want to know more about it and its benefits and tradition. Also, those who want to understand 
        why it is considered valuable to those who drink it. I supposed them to find the page through different devices such as mobile devices, desktops, laptops, and any other with internet access.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>How to Prepare Mate</h3>
      <p>
        <p>How to prepare Mate:<br>
        Through this content, I will share more about how a traditional mate has to be prepared step 
        by step to be able to drink it. It will also explain and clarify and to make especial 
        preparation to the mate that it’s made with gourd or wood. </p>
        <p>The steps to prepare a mate are six:<br><br>
          1.	Heat water between 158°F to 167°F (70°C/75°c). If it’s your first time drinking mate I 
        recommend not to drink it too hot. <br>
          2.	While the water is heating take the mate cup and fill it with ¾ parts of yerba.<br>
          3.	Cover the mouth of the mate with your hand and shake it. Return the mate to its original 
          position but leave the yerba at 45°.<br>
          4.  Pour a little warm water (around 122°F) into the emptiest part of the mate.<br>
          5.	Insert the straw in the same place as in the previous step to the bottom of the mate.<br>
          6.	Pour the hot water from the side of the straw until the mate is filled.</p>
          It is ready to drink!
        </p>

        <p>Other ways to prepare Mate:<br>
        There are more ways to drink Mate if the traditional way is not what you prefer.</p>
        <p>Sugar: Mate has a naturally bitter taste, that is the way many people in Argentina use to put 
        a little portion of sugar each time a mate is served or in the water recipient. It is also valid 
        to use sweetener or honey as an alternative option.<br><br>

        Mate with flavor: Another alternative is to add flavor to your mates, like little pieces of 
        lemon, orange, or grapefruit. <br><br>

        Tereré: Especially drink it in Paraguay, tereré is a mate but with cold water. It is the best 
        preferred in summer when the heats arise. It can also be made with juice or different natural herbs. <br><br>

        Mate Cocido (Boil Mate): It is Yerba Mate in a tea bag, you can also use a strainer to filter 
        the mate tea. The only difference is that you have to boil the water before serving.<br><br>

        Mate with milk: As an alternative to water, you can also serve it with milk. It also works for the boil mate.<br><br>

        Grapefruit: You can make a mate in a grapefruit! </p>
